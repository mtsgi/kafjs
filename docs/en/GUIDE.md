# Usage Guide

We'll show you how to use kaf.js with actual examples. kaf.js has four main features: **kaf data**, **kaf events**, **i18n support functions**, and **style control**.

Let's go through each tutorial in turn.

#### [[Chapter 1] KAF Data](/en/kafdata)

**kaf data** is a fundamental feature of kaf.js.

#### [[Chapter 2] KAF Events](/en/kafevents)

The **kaf event** feature allows you to register JavaScript functions as **Events** and manage them easily, as well as **clarify the relationships** between HTML elements and events.


#### [[Chapter 3] i18n Support Feature](/en/i18n)

The kaf.js is the easiest way to **make your website multilingual**. This is called the **i18n support feature** in kaf.js.

#### [[Chapter 4] Style Controlling](/en/style)

kaf.js has the distinctive ability to control *scope-restricted* styles with **JavaScript object notation**. You no longer need to write CSS with complex selectors, or precompile with SASS at build time.
